Java port of PHP function library to facilitate Java web development

It'll be impossible to port all of it, but the vast majority of PHP will be implementable in Java. Some of the biggest things that won't be possible are syntactic sugar, and mixed return types, so don't go expecting miracles. No namespaces, traits, shiny new 5.6 features, and all that jazz. Just pure PHP style with less Java malarchy, while still being Java.

CALLOUT: Developers needed to implement PHP functions. Knowledge of both PHP and Java is preferrable, but the PHP docs describe what each function does, so just having Java experience is not a huge deal. However, some functions are pass by reference, so it's highly desirable to have at least some knowledge of pointers.
