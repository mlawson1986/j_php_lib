Java port of PHP function library to facilitate Java web development

While every feature of PHP will be impossible to port, such as mixed return types. Thefore, I am working on a class that will serve as this mixed type, which will require some amount of casting or generics to be used when the PHP library is being used. 

3/30/2014: Mixed type is under testing. Need to get this perfect until moving much further because it's central to how many PHP functions will execute. 

CALLOUT: Developers needed to implement PHP functions. Knowledge of both PHP and Java is preferrable, but the PHP docs describe what each function does, so just have Java experience is not a huge deal. However, some functions are pass by reference, so it's highly desirable to have at least some knowledge of pointers.
